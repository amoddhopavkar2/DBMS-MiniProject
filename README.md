# GST-Collection
Analyse various aspects of GST collection and calculate the GST due for a small business.

## Introduction - 
Depending upon whether a particular product is going to be sold within the same state, or outside the state in which it is manufactured; the  GST is calculated differently.
For products to be sold within the same state, the total GST is divided into CGST and SGST (each half of the total).
Whereas, for a product sold outside of the state in which it is manufactured; a single entity 'IGST' is levied.

The traders are also entitled for GST refund in which the GST paid by a trader for any business related expense is subtracted from the total GST due.

Thus, Total GST due = (GST collected) - (GST paid for business related expenditure)
